Basic description of this game.

â€‹	When a company executes a project, it is often necessary to prepare several solutions to the same problem, but only the best solution is used in the final execution. This game is designed to help project managers to select the best solution at a non-technical level.

In this game, we set some milestone nodes to represent the different types of problems that may be encountered during the project research. When playing the game, players will randomly draw different kinds of problems that correspond to the non-technical challenges that the solution may encounter, and if the player cannot successfully solve the problem, our game will reflect the risk of this problem by means of points. And if all the problems drawn are successfully solved, our game will use a point bonus as well as a top progress bonus to show that the solution can avoid the potential risk of that problem.

To make the game more interesting, we add 'number of dice rolls' to the game's winning condition. A low number of dice rolls not only indicates the low non-technical risk of the solution, but also demonstrates that the team leader of the solution is strong enough to cope with various non-technical challenges.

 

Introduction to the rules of the game.

- Participants of the game.
  - Players:
    - If we have N solutions, then N players are needed, and each player represents a solution leader (Group leader).
    - Each player starts the game with a base score of 0 points.
  - God:
    - The manager, shareholder of the project or the project owner
- Preparation for the start of the game.

  - Each participating player needs to list Project-related questions for 3 different milestones (at least 3 questions for each category), which God will check and eliminate duplicate or similar questions and then put in the question pool.
- Play method.
  - Step1: Players get the number of steps n to advance by rolling the dice, at the same time, this is also the number of problem cards drawn
  - Step2: According to the player's position in the game map (that is, the milestone node) randomly draw the corresponding question pool of cards, a total of N question cards, if the card drawn before, then redraw.
  - Step3: Players answer the questions drawn and put the question cards back into the question pool after they finish answering.
  - Step4: Move the piece forward N moves, regardless of whether the question is answered correctly or not.
  - Step5: Repeat Step1-4.
  - Step6: When all players' pieces reach the end of the game map, the game ends.

- Reward and punishment rules.
  - God needs to judge whether each player's answer is reasonable, if other players have objections to the answer can be raised to God.
  - If the player answers the question correctly, he will get 1 point, if not, 1 point will be deducted.
  - Players who answer all the questions correctly will be awarded 2 points and will be able to advance 2 more steps.
  - If the player draws questions that are all answered incorrectly, the player is penalized by suspending the next round of dice rolls.

- Winning conditions.
  - Case1: The player with the most points wins directly (i.e. the number of dice rolls is not considered at this point).
  - Case2: If the players have the same number of points, the player with the least number of dice rolls wins.
